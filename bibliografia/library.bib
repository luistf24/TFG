abstract = {MTProto 2.0 is a suite of cryptographic protocols for instant messaging at the core of the popular Telegram messenger application. In this paper we analyse MTProto 2.0 using the symbolic verifier ProVerif. We provide fully automated proofs of the soundness of MTProto 2.0's authentication, normal chat, end-to-end encrypted chat, and rekeying mechanisms with respect to several security properties, including authentication, integrity, secrecy and perfect forward secrecy; at the same time, we discover that the rekeying protocol is vulnerable to an unknown key-share (UKS) attack. We proceed in an incremental way: each protocol is examined in isolation, relying only on the guarantees provided by the previous ones and the robustness of the basic cryptographic primitives. Our research proves the formal correctness of MTProto 2.0 w.r.t. most relevant security properties, and it can serve as a reference for implementation and analysis of clients and servers.},

@article{1024RSA,
abstract = {As many cryptographic schemes rely on the hardness of integer factorization, exploration of the concrete costs of factoring large integers is of considerable interest. Most research has focused on PC-based implementations of factoring algorithms; these have successfully factored 530-bit integers, but practically cannot scale much further. Recent works have placed the bottleneck at the sieving step of the Number Field Sieve algorithm. We present a new implementation of this step, based on a custom-built hardware device that achieves a very high level of parallelism "for free". The design combines algorithmic and technological aspects: by devising algorithms that take advantage of certain tradeoffs in chip manufacturing technology, efficiency is increased by many orders of magnitude compared to previous proposals. Using this hypothetical device (and ignoring the initial R{\&}D costs), it appears possible to break a 1024-bit RSA key in one year using a device whose cost is about {\$}10M (previous predictions were in the trillions of dollars).},

@article{Wang2005,
abstract = {MD5 is one of the most widely used cryptographic hash functions nowadays. It was designed in 1992 as an improvement of MD4, and its security was widely studied since then by several authors. The best known result so far was a semi free-start collision, in which the initial value of the hash function is replaced by a non-standard value, which is the result of the attack. In this paper we present a new powerful attack on MD5 which allows us to find collisions efficiently. We used this attack to find collisions of MD5 in about 15 minutes up to an hour computation time. The attack is a differential attack, which unlike most differential attacks, does not use the exclusive-or as a measure of difference, but instead uses modular integer subtraction as the measure. We call this kind of differential a modular differential. An application of this attack to MD4 can find a collision in less than a fraction of a second. This attack is also applicable to other hash functions, such as RIPEMD and HAVAL. {\textcopyright} International Association for Cryptologic Research 2005.},

abstract = {Cryptographic hash function is an important cryptographic tool in the field of information security. Design of most widely used hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1 is based on the iterations of compression function by Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction method with constant initialization vector. Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction showed that the security of hash function depends on the security of the compression function. Several attacks on Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction based hash functions motivated researchers to propose different cryptographic constructions to enhance the security of hash functions against the differential and generic attacks. Cryptographic community had been looking for replacements for these weak hash functions and they have proposed new hash functions based on different variants of Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction. As a result of an open competition NIST announced Keccak as a SHA-3 standard. This paper provides a review of cryptographic hash function, its security requirements and different design methods of compression function.},

abstract = {This report is on the Secure Hash Algorithm family, better known as the SHA hash functions. We will try to analyse how these functions work, focussing especially on the SHA-1 hash function. After dissecting the SHA-1 hash function itself, we will relate and compare it to the other hash functions in the SHA family, SHA-0 and SHA-2. Besides analysing the specific SHA functions, we will also treat the generic structure of hash functions, as these are relevant for the security of a hash function. We will treat the different aspects in some detail and illustrate how naive implementation of hash functions can be hazardous for the security, some attacks can be mounted against any hash function if they are not implemented correctly. The main part of this report will focus on the alleged weaknesses found in the SHA- 0 hash function by different scientists. We first explain how the SHA-0 function was initially broken by treating the so-called differential collision search against this function. After explaining how the idea works, we will explain why this attack is less successful against the SHA-0 successor, SHA-1. Finally we will look at SHA-2 and summarize the cryptanalysis results for the SHA family. The last part will deal with the implications of broken hash functions, and how dangerous these actually are. Although the weaknesses found may not seem all too severe, these attacks can indeed have serious consequences, as we will see in the final section.},

abstract = {The Signal protocol is a cryptographic messaging protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging in WhatsApp, Wire, and Facebook Messenger among many others, serving well over 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as “future secrecy” or “post-compromise security”), enabled by a technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. We conduct a formal security analysis of Signal's initial extended triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) key agreement and Double Ratchet protocols as a multi-stage authenticated key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol and define a security model which can capture the “ratcheting” key update structure as a multi-stage model where there can be a “tree” of stages, rather than just a sequence. We then prove the security of Signal's key exchange core in our model, demonstrating several standard security properties. We have found no major flaws in the design and hope that our presentation and results can serve as a foundation for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

abstract = {The growth of content delivery networks (CDNs) has engendered centralized control over the serving of internet content. An unwanted by-product of this growth is that CDNs are fast becoming global arbiters for which content requests are allowed and which are blocked in an attempt to stanch malicious traffic. In particular, in some cases honest users-especially those behind shared IP addresses, including users of privacy tools such as Tor, VPNs, and I2P - can be unfairly targeted by attempted ‘catch-all solutions' that assume these users are acting maliciously. In this work, we provide a solution to prevent users from being exposed to a disproportionate amount of internet challenges such as CAPTCHAs. These challenges are at the very least annoying and at their worst - when coupled with bad implementations - can completely block access from web resources. We detail a 1-RTT cryptographic protocol (based on an implementation of an oblivious pseudorandom function) that allows users to receive a significant amount of anonymous tokens for each challenge solution that they provide. These tokens can be exchanged in the future for access without having to interact with a challenge. We have implemented our initial solution in a browser extension named “Privacy Pass”, and have worked with the Cloudflare CDN to deploy compatible server-side components in their infrastructure. However, we envisage that our solution could be used more generally for many applications where anonymous and honest access can be granted (e.g., anonymous wiki editing). The anonymity guarantee of our solution makes it immediately appropriate for use by users of Tor/VPNs/ I2P. We also publish figures from Cloudflare indicating the potential impact from the global release of Privacy Pass.},

abstract = {In spite of the central role of key derivation functions (KDF) in applied cryptography, there has been little formal work addressing the design and analysis of general multipurpose KDFs. In practice, most KDFs (including those widely standardized) follow ad-hoc approaches that treat cryptographic hash functions as perfectly random functions. In this paper we close some gaps between theory and practice by contributing to the study and engineering of KDFs in several ways. We provide detailed rationale for the design of KDFs based on the extract-then-expand approach; we present the first general and rigorous definition of KDFs and their security which we base on the notion of computational extractors; we specify a concrete fully practical KDF based on the HMAC construction; and we provide an analysis of this construction based on the extraction and pseudorandom properties of HMAC. The resultant KDF design can support a large variety of KDF applications under suitable assumptions on the underlying hash function; particular attention and effort is devoted to minimizing these assumptions as much as possible for each usage scenario. Beyond the theoretical interest in modeling KDFs, this work is intended to address two important and timely needs of cryptographic applications: (i) providing a single hash-based KDF design that can be standardized for use in multiple and diverse applications, and (ii) providing a conservative, yet efficient, design that exercises much care in the way it utilizes a cryptographic hash function. (The HMAC-based scheme presented here, named HKDF, is being standardized by the IETF.)},

abstract = {The SHA-1 hash function was designed in 1995 and has been widely used during two decades. A theoretical collision attack was first proposed in 2004 [29], but due to its high complexity it was only implemented in practice in 2017, using a large GPU cluster [23]. More recently, an almost practical chosen-prefix collision attack against SHA-1 has been proposed [12]. This more powerful attack allows to build colliding messages with two arbitrary prefixes, which is much more threatening for real protocols. In this paper, we report the first practical implementation of this attack, and its impact on real-world security with a PGP/GnuPG impersonation attack. We managed to significantly reduce the complexity of collision attacks against SHA-1: on an Nvidia GTX 970, identical-prefix collisions can now be computed with a complexity (expressed in terms of SHA-1 equivalents on this GPU) of 2 61.2 rather than 2 64.7 , and chosen-prefix collisions with a complexity of 2 63.4 rather than 2 67.1. When renting cheap GPUs, this translates to a cost of US{\$} 11k for a collision, and US{\$} 45k for a chosen-prefix collision, within the means of academic researchers. Our actual attack required two months of computations using 900 Nvidia GTX 1060 GPUs (we paid US{\$} 75k because GPU prices were higher, and we wasted some time preparing the attack). Therefore, the same attacks that have been practical on MD5 since 2009 are now practical on SHA-1. In particular, chosen-prefix collisions can break signature schemes and handshake security in secure channel protocols (TLS, SSH), if generated extremely quickly. We strongly advise to remove SHA-1 from those type of applications as soon as possible. We exemplify our cryptanalysis by creating a pair of PGP/GnuPG keys with different identities, but colliding SHA-1 certificates. A SHA-1 certification of the first key can therefore be transferred to the second key, leading to an impersonation attack. This proves that SHA-1 signatures now offer virtually no security in practice.
